# Dapp_app

Ballot dapp application written in Solidity. 
to help developers who start in building Ethereum's Dapps i had written this web application.
This app is a webpage (for ballot) that uses web3 and interact with the blockchain (mainet, testnet or local private).

The idea is to create a web interface for the exemple provided in the official documentation : http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html.

to try this app you need :

1- setup a private localchain or use the testnet (creat account,.....)
2- install Mist (the Dapp browser)
3- deploy the contract provided in ballot.sol  
4- change the address in the functions.js by your contract address
